# ElasticMD
ElasticMD is a Python package for computing elastic moduli from stress-strain data generated from a LAMMPS simulation. The main feature of this software is the two GUIs for computing Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios, and shear modulus.

Below are screenshots of the two GUIs. The first image is the uniaxial analysis GUI and the second image is the shear analysis GUI.

To Do:
* Make a PySimpleGUI for bulk modulus
